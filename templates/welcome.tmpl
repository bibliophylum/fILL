  <strong>Monday 19th December 2014 Release notes</strong>
  <p>The improvements represented below have been inspired through the collective input received from the library community and some have been integrated from direct feedback. We will continue to refine areas of the site wherever necessary and your ongoing support and advice is very much appreciated. If your library has ideas on how we can improve fILL together, please send your thoughts to <a href="mailto:pls@gov.mb.ca">pls@gov.mb.ca</a></p>
<h3>Updates and bug fixes</h3>

  <strong>Monday 24th November Release notes</strong>
  <p>We invited your first impressions about the newly redesigned fILL platform and we've received a great response from libraries across the province.</p>
  <p>Since re-launching the platform on November 18th, the fILL development team has been working to incorporate great ideas raised by the library community, address some of your critiques and further refine the platform in order to make improvements that can benefit all invested in resource sharing; from creating a more responsive user experience and effective operations to management and policy controls in order to make it easier than ever to manage your library's ILL workflows.</p>
  <p>We hope the fixes and features released today are helpful to you and your colleagues:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dividing lines placed in-between rows in tables, to clearly indicate which buttons belong to which records</li>
    <li>Due date bug fixed - the default date no longer overrides the date you entered</li>
    <li>Publication date field added to 'New patron requests' table, so you can see if an item is too new to request</li>
    <li>New alert message on welcome page; The current alert is a reminder to be mindful when placing requests for newer items</li>
    <li>Wish list (see below)</li>
    <li>GID and CID, placed into 'place request' page (see below)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Wish List</h3>
  <p>There is now a new section in fILL under 'Accounts' called 'Wish list'. The Wish list page will help you file away titles that you may wish to acquire instead of place an ILL. When viewing your 'New patron requests' you may decide that an item is too new or too popular to request through ILL, you can now choose 'Add to Wish list' and the information of the request will be placed in the Wish list page. You can also 'Add to Wish list' from the Unfilled tab.  The table on this page can then be printed or downloaded or saved as usual. If you choose to do so, you can forward the list onto your collections staff for consideration for purchase.</p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> moving requests to the wish list cancels the ILL, so you may want to contact your patron beforehand to let them know.</p>
  <h3>GID and CID</h3>
  <p>We had feedback from libraries about the removal of the GID and CID numbers from the tables. Previously we had thought that this functionality was only useful for the internal working of fILL. We have made the GID and CID numbers available on the 'place request' page for your reference. Some libraries have noted that they use the numbers to track Canada Post items, we are currently investigating how we can use the Canada Post tracking number to address this issue.</p>

  <strong>18th November 2014</strong>
  <h3>Refresh of the fILL Librarian interface</h3>
  <p>We hope your patrons have discovered the fresh public face of fILL and that the redisign has made their experience and your ILL workflows easier.
    We have collected a lot of constructive feedback around this development and your support has been extremely helpful in improving the system and
    accessibility overall.</p>
  <p>Over the last several months, the fILL development team at PLSB has received many great suggestions from the library community regarding how we can 
    improve the fILL dashboard for interlibrary loan staff.  We are very excited to share that we've been able to incorporate many of your ideas and
    they are available to everyone today!  There are some remaining suggestions that could not be immediately achieved which have been documented and
    will be considered for future development.  We believe these improvements will make it easier for interlibrary loan staff to navigate the fILL
    platform, view the information, perform various ILL related tasks and maximize efficiency by improving local workflows.</p>
  <p>Your ongoing feedback is key to ensure our development resources are focused on the elements and features that are important across the library
    community.  Once you've had a chance to review the changes, we'd really appreciate if you would let us know what you think and share your first
    impressions with us be sending your feedback to <a href="mailto:pls@gov.mb.ca">pls@gov.mb.ca</a>.</p>
  <p>Among the many user interface updates you'll see:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Larger text</li>
    <li>Enhanced menu notifications</li>
    <li>Accessibility features</li>
  </ul>
  <p>- the fILL development team</p>
