  <h2>Updates</h2>

  <strong>18th November 2014</strong>
  <h3>Refresh of the fILL Librarian interface</h3>
  <p>We hope your patrons have discovered the fresh public face of fILL and that the redisign has made their experience and your ILL workflows easier.
    We have collected a lot of constructive feedback around this development and your support has been extremely helpful in improving the system and
    accessibility overall.</p>
  <p>Over the last several months, the fILL development team at PLSB has received many great suggestions from the library community regarding how we can 
    improve the fILL dashboard for interlibrary loan staff.  We are very excited to share that we've been able to incorporate many of your ideas and
    they are available to everyone today!  There are some remaining suggestions that could not be immediately achieved which have been documented and
    will be considered for future development.  We believe these improvements will make it easier for interlibrary loan staff to navigate the fILL
    platform, view the information, perform various ILL related tasks and maximize efficiency by improving local workflows.</p>
  <p>Your ongoing feedback is key to ensure our development resources are focused on the elements and features that are important across the library
    community.  Once you've had a chance to review the changes, we'd really appreciate if you would let us know what you think and share your first
    impressions with us be sending your feedback to <a href="mailto:pls@gov.mb.ca">pls@gov.mb.ca</a>.</p>
