      <h3>About fILL, the Manitoba public libraries interlibrary-loan requesting system.</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
	fILL enables you to quickly search the catalogues of many Manitoba public libraries at once.  When you find an item that you'd like to request, it enables you to ask your home library to try to get it for you.

      <h3>Privacy</h3>
      <p>
	fILL does not keep any record of your searches or requests after your books are returned.  
	Logging in is necessary for your library to know who is making the request, but no information 
	linking your account to any searches or requests is kept after the ILL transaction is completed.
	Some non-identifying data may be retained for statistical purposes.
