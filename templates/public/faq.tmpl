<a name="q1"><h3>How long does it take to get something delivered?</h3></a>
	<p>Wait times can vary.  Items already on loan can take longer to be delivered.  Typically, it takes between a week to  two weeks for an item to be delivered.  And some items may never be delivered because not all libraries participate in the inter-library loan program.</p>

<a name="q2"><h3>Where does the requested item come from?</h3></a>
	<p>The item that you have requested could come from any public library in Manitoba.</p>

<a name="q3"><h3>Why can&rsquo;t it just get sent to my home?</h3></a>
	<p>Your library membership entitles you to borrow from your local library only.  Your local library can loan you materials from another library, as they have borrowed on their behalf.</p>

<a name="q4"><h3>Why is it called fILL?</h3></a>
	<p>It is called fILL because with the software we are able to easily <strong>fill</strong> your inter-library loan request.</p>

<a name="q5"><h3>Can I renew my items?</h3></a>
	<p>You will not be able to review the item directly. You can make a renewal request at your library and they will make the request from the lender and notify you.  It is a local policy decision to allow inter-library loan items to be renewed.</p>

<a name="q6"><h3>How many items can I request at one time?</h3></a>
	<p>The maximum number of items a patron can take out at  one time  is up to your public library.</p>

<a name="q7"><h3>What happens if the item I want is already on loan?</h3></a>
	<p>Your local library will place a hold on the item, after it is returned, it will be delivered to your library for pick up.</p>

<a name="q8"><h3>Do I pay late fines at my local public library or to library the item came from</h3></a>
	<p>You pay your late fees at your local public library.</p>
