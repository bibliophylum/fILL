Need to install package libfile-pid-perl:
$ sudo aptitude install libfile-pid-perl

Copy fILL/externals/fILL-chat-server to init.d:
$ sudo cp ~/prj/fILL/externals/fILL-chat-server /etc/init.d
$ sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/fILL-chat-server

Add this to /opt/fILL/conf/fILL.conf (in virtualhost 443, right at the end):
# Note, this is the preferred ProxyPass configuration, and *should* be equivalent
# to the same inline version below, but it does NOT WORK!
#<Location /app/ws/>
#        ProxyPass wss://localhost:8443/app/ws
#        ProxyPassReverse wss://localhost:8443/app/ws
#</Location>
#<Location /app/>
#        ProxyPass https://localhost:8443/app/
#        ProxyPassReverse https://localhost:8443/app/
#</Location>

# NOTE: Pay strict attention to the slashes "/" or lack thereof!
# WebSocket url endpoint
        ProxyPass /app/ws/ wss://localhost:8088/app/ws
        ProxyPassReverse /app/ws/ wss://localhost:8088/app/ws

        # Everything else
  	ProxyPass /app/ https://localhost:8088/app/
	ProxyPassReverse /app/ https://localhost:8088/app/



------------------
You'll need to enable apache module proxy_wstunnel.

------------------
wsUri needs to be updated in fILL-chat-1.0.js, templates/public/contact.tmpl, and htdocs/chat-test.html

$DEBUG is currently turned on in bin/chat-server.pl

------------------
Current versions of Firefox disable insecure websockets by default (i.e. without actual security cert).
This makes it difficult to develop...
Going to firefox's about:config and toggling network.websocket.allowInsecureFromHTTPS will get rid of the SecurityError.

------------------
Shutting down the chat server doesn't seem to work cleanly... may need to manually kill the process.  Need to figure this out....

------------------
Libraries automatically join channel 'syschan' when they log in.  This lets the chat server know that 
they are on (so that when a patron of that library creates a chat, the chat server can look up the 
proper connection for the library).

Libraries can communicate with other libraries on syschan.

Patrons will have dedicated channels, so they are talking one-on-one with their library.
