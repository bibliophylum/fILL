Allow searching (only those libraries in pazpar2/settings-enabled will be searched).
Disable requesting unless the logged-in library has opted in.
Disable functions (e.g. 'return') to libraries that have not opted in.

Logged-in library's OID is in header, $(oid)
"Click to request" button is in fILL-client-1.8.js, line 602
searchForm is in templates/header.tmpl, line 283

Code to skip closed Spruce libraries is in fILL-client-1.8.js, line 533
     and lightning.tmpl, line 45
     and bin/get-Spruce-closed.cgi
This could do double duty in the context of opt-in... but that might be confusing.


So...
Need:
Ok	1. "opted-in" field in org
Ok	2. cgi-bin/has-opted-in.cgi (pass OID, return boolean)
Ok	3. Disable "Click to request" button unless opted-in
Ok	4. Message by "Search" re: requesting not available, unless opted-in
Ok	5. Message on home re: opt-in
	6. Have all relevent actions check for opt-in status of targets
Ok	   pending
Ok	   unfilled
Ok	   holds placed
Ok	   receiving
Ok	   renewals
Ok	   returns
Ok	   overdue (borrowing)
	   --------
Ok	   pull list
Ok	   respond
Ok	   on hold
Ok	   shipping
Ok	   renewal requests
Ok	   lost
Ok	   check-ins
Ok	   overdue (lending)
	   -------
	   Current borrowing/lending?
	   
	7. Verify skipping closed Spruce libraries / set all Spruce libs to closed.
	8. Set pazpar2/settings-enabled for opted-in libraries.

Nice to have:
        1. "opted-in" status board (thought: split into Spruce / non-Spruce....)
	   Can use reports > contacts....


header.tmpl calls bin/has-opted-in.cgi, stores result in window.ILLStatus.opt_in (true or false)
