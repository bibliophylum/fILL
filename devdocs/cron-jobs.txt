Cron jobs that need to be run as root (i.e. "sudo crontab -e" to set up):

1. Every 5 minutes, check if a pazpar restart has been requested (via fILL admin)
   crontab entry:
   */5 * * * * /opt/fILL/externals/pazpar-restart-if-requested.sh >/dev/null 2>&1

2. Once/day (at midnight), restart pazpar regardless
   crontab entry:
   0 0 * * * /opt/fILL/externals/pazpar-restart.sh >/dev/null 2>&1

3. Once/day (at midnight), clear old patrons (i.e. no active requests, and haven't logged in in the last month)
   crontab entry:
   0 0 * * * /opt/fILL/externals/clear-old-patrons.pl >/dev/null 2>&1
