Just a quick note:  

Using the Perl Selenium::Remote::Driver for automated UI testing, tests got borked when Firefox updated (always went to the FF firstrun page rather than the URL listed in the tests).

Solution:  update Selenium::Remote::Driver (latest update at time of writing, 2016.01.12)
$ sudo perl -MCPAN -e shell
cpan[1]> install Selenium::Remote::Driver

Also updated selenium-server-standalone from 2.46.0 to 2.49.0, from selenium web site.
