Setting up your dev environment:

sudo groupadd devel
sudo usermod -G devel david


Note that install.sh needs to be tweaked for the first install...
- add conf and logs to the directories being copied
- uncomment the bits about symlinking fILL.conf to apache2/sites-available
- uncomment the bits about apache2 in general...
