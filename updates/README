Any changes to the PostgreSQL table structure should go here.

Eg: if we wanted to add a column, 'foo', to the table 'request', create a file called 00.add-foo-column-to-request.sql containing:

alter table request add column foo varchar(80);

Replace the '00.' in the file name with the next available sequence number; the idea is that you can start at 00 and apply each sql file in turn to end up with a "current" database structure.

There are two starting points:
00.initial-empty.sql - just creates the database
or
00.initial-with-data.sql - creates the database, and populates it with some test data
