Test if your libgd has png support:
perl -e 'use GD; $im=GD::Image->new(); print $im->can("png") ? "yes" : "no" , "\n";'

If it doesn't, download the libgd source adn compile... you'll need to ./configure --with-png
Then make, sudo make install, and get into CPAN shell to 'force install GD' ot have it pick up the new library.
