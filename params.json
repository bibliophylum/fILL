Life cycle management is based on the message types and states in ISO 10161 (Interlibrary Loan Application Protocol Specification).  [ISO 10161](http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/iso/ill/stan1611.htm)\r\n\r\n### Simple, powerful client-side\r\nThe client side uses jQuery and the fantastic DataTables plugin ([jQuery DataTables](http://datatables.net/)) to provide sortable, searchable lists throughout the application.  Almost everything in the system is presented to the user in these powerful tables - current requests, pull-lists, requests waiting for responses, etc.\r\n\r\n","name":"fILL","tagline":"Free/Open-Source Software Interlibrary Loan Management System","google":""}
